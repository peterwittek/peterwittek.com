    "Introduction\n",
    "===============\n",
    "Continuous-variable (CV) quantum info is a lot less studied than the qubit/qudit scenario. Having spent a few days trying to learn the basics, I can understand why. The theory is often still tied to experimental setups, so when I would expect a formula for a state, I get something like \"the squeezed states were created in the side bands of spatially separated beams of a Nd:YAG 1064nm laser\" ([arXiv:1801.03194](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03194)). So I thought a good start would be studying the kind of Bell scenarios with which I have some familiarity. The paper [arXiv:1012.1916](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1916) gives a very simple and mathematically clear scenario that can easily be implemented in [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we use a blend of two views. Alice and Bob can perform two measurements each like in a regular [CHSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHSH_inequality) setting, but instead of the usual configuration of Pauli measurements, one of their measurements is the photon number $N$ and the other is the $X$ quadrature. The former takes discrete values and the latter continues ones. The measurement results are postprocessed to obtain outcomes in $a,b\\in\\{-1,+1\\}$, where $a$ and $b$ label Alice and Bob's outcomes respectively, again, just like in a regular CHSH setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "When measuring $N$, we set the outcome to $+1$ if the result is $N>0$, and to $-1$ if the result is $N=0$. For the $X$ measurement, we single out an interval $[-z, z]$. We output $+1$ if $x\\in [-z, z]$ and $-1$ if $x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus [-z, z]$. The choice of $z$ depends on how we deal with $\\hbar$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these measurements, we use the CHSH inequality:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S=E_{XX}+E_{XN}+E_{NX}-E_{NN}\\leq 2,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $E_{jk}=P(a=b|jk)-P(a\\neq b|jk)$ is the expectation value of the measurements $j$ and $k$ after the binning."

Therefore the dimension of the system that generated the correlations does not play any role: it works for discrete and CV systems.
