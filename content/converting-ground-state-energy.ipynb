    "[Ncpol2sdpa](http://peterwittek.github.io/ncpol2sdpa/) is a tool to generate the SDP relaxation given a noncommutative polynomial optimization. It works both in Matlab and Python. The Matlab variant has serious limitations, as it uses [Yalmip](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/) as its back-end, which only has rudimentary support for noncommutative variables. Hermitian variables are not supported, which makes generating relaxations error-prone. On the other hand, this variant efficiently deals with equality constraints by solving the set of equalities with QR decomposition. It is also capable of using a wide range of solvers. The Matlab version does not scale beyond a lattice of 2×2, and numerical errors appear, leaving imaginary values in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python variant uses [SymPy](http://sympy.org/), which excels at noncommutative and Hermitian variables, allowing operations such Hermitian conjugates, commutators, and anticommutators. To solve the SDP relaxation or export it to sparse SDPA format, Ncpol2sdpa uses [PICOS](http://picos.zib.de/). Translation between noncommutative SymPy monomials and PICOS variables is mechanical. Equations are converted to a pair of inequalities in the background, making the SDP relaxations large.\n",

    "-----------\n",
    "Generating an SDP relaxation and solving it are two different matters. PICOS interfaces with SDP solvers implemented in Python. These are not scalable to a cluster. PICOS can also export to sparse SDPA format, which is far more desirable, given SDPARA can solve a problem on a cluster. Yet, writing the problem to the disk is not as straightforward as it seems. Memory use increases further, and the process will be killed even in the case of a 4×4 lattice. It is interesting to note that the 3×3 lattice takes about a hundred seconds to generate and write, and solving it on a single node using SDPARA with twelve cores takes about the same time. Perhaps distributing the generation of the problem would help overcome the memory and time constraints.\n",
