      "[Ncpol2sdpa](http://peterwittek.github.io/ncpol2sdpa/) is a tool to generate the SDP relaxation given a noncommutative polynomial optimization. It works both in Matlab and Python. The Matlab variant has serious limitations, as it uses [Yalmip](http://users.isy.liu.se/johanl/yalmip/) as its back-end, which only has rudimentary support for noncommutative variables. Hermitian variables are not supported, which makes generating relaxations error-prone. On the other hand, this variant efficiently deals with equality constraints by solving the set of equalities with QR decomposition. It is also capable of using a wide range of solvers. The Matlab version does not scale beyond a lattice of 2\u00d72, and numerical errors appear, leaving imaginary values in the objective function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Python variant uses [SymPy](http://sympy.org/), which excels at noncommutative and Hermitian variables, allowing operations such Hermitian conjugates, commutators, and anticommutators. To solve the SDP relaxation or export it to sparse SDPA format, Ncpol2sdpa uses [PICOS](http://picos.zib.de/). Translation between noncommutative SymPy monomials and PICOS variables is mechanical. Equations are converted to a pair of inequalities in the background, making the SDP relaxations large.\n",

      "Generating an SDP relaxation and solving it are two different matters. PICOS interfaces with SDP solvers implemented in Python. These are not scalable to a cluster. PICOS can also export to sparse SDPA format, which is far more desirable, given SDPARA can solve a problem on a cluster. Yet, writing the problem to the disk is not as straightforward as it seems. Memory use increases further, and the process will be killed even in the case of a 4\u00d74 lattice. It is interesting to note that the 3\u00d73 lattice takes about a hundred seconds to generate and write, and solving it on a single node using SDPARA with twelve cores takes about the same time. Perhaps distributing the generation of the problem would help overcome the memory and time constraints.\n",
