      "This is the commutative toy example in  <a href=\"#pironio2010convergent\">Pironio et al.,&nbsp;2010</a>, which extends the semidefinite relaxations of constrained polynomial optimization problems (<a href=\"#lasserre2001global\">Lasserre,&nbsp;2001</a>)  to noncommutative variables. The number of variables in the corresponding semidefinite programming (SDP) problem grows fast as the number of variables in the original problem increases. To achieve a scalable solution, we would like to solve the SDP with [SDPARA](http://sdpa.sourceforge.net/), a distributed solver that also has a new GPU-accelerated variant (<a href=\"#fujisawa2012high\">Fujisawa et al.,&nbsp;2012</a>). Working towards this goal, we look at how the second order relaxation can be exported with [PICOS](http://picos.zib.de/). The toy example in <a href=\"#pironio2010convergent\">Pironio et al.,&nbsp;2010</a> applies a small trick, eliminating the equality constraint from the monomial basis. This is a non-trivial problem in general. We look at two solutions, the first one follows the toy example word by word, the second deals with the equality by adding a localizing matrix.\n",

      "In this case, we do not eliminate the idempotent element from the monomial basis. For more complex equalities, this would prove difficult. Instead, we define a new localizing matrix. The equality equation of the localizing matrix is in turn converted to a pair of positive semidefinite constraints in the background, which increases the size of the problem. While seemingly undesirable, the solution is efficient. Other methods of dealing with equalities, for instance, a QR factorization and a subsequent projection to the new basis, would run on a *single* node. Whereas if we increase the complexity of the SDP problem, we multiple nodes and, potentially, GPU resources to compute the optimum. Generating the SDP problem fast and solving it on a cluster lead to an efficient solution in terms of computational time, and also in terms of human effort.\n",
