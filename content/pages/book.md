Quantum Machine Learning: What Quantum Computing Means to Data Mining
---------------------------------------------------------------------

![Cover of Quantum Machine
Learning](http://peterwittek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cover-199x300.jpg)Machine
learning has become indispensable in discovering patterns in large data
sets, and the theory is at the core of a larger set of tools known as
data mining. It is a mature field with an astonishing array of practical
applications.

Quantum computing has the potential of taking machine learning to the
next level. While hardware implementations of quantum computing systems
are still in an initial phase, recent theoretical developments hint at
the benefits of applying quantum methods to learning algorithms.

Computational complexity can be reduced exponentially in some cases,
whereas we see quadratic reduction in others. Yet, improved learning
time is just one part of the equation. Through nonconvex objective
functions, quantum machine learning algorithms are more robust to noise
and outliers, which makes their generalization performance better than
many known classical algorithms. Examples include quantum support vector
machines, learning a function by quantum process tomography, quantum
neural networks, and adiabatic quantum optimization.

Quantum Machine Learning: What Quantum Computing Means to Data Mining
explains the most relevant concepts of machine learning, quantum
mechanics, and quantum information theory, and contrasts classical
learning algorithms to their quantum counterparts.
