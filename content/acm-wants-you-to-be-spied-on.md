Summary: ACM member's forwarding email address must undergo filtering by Google. Your email correspondence cannot escape the attention of NSA.

I am a fortunate person: I do not use Apple or Microsoft products, and
my use of Google is limited to their scholarly services. My pattern of
using Facebook is under strict control. Hence the NSA scandal left me
relatively unscathed: perhaps there are still bits of my personal data
that the NSA does not have yet. At least this is what I thought.

The ACM membership comes with a forwarding email address, which is useful if
you anticipate frequent changes of your affiliation and you want to maintain
a professional and permanent email address. ACM applies spam filtering
before the mails are forwarded -- a commendable act given the sheer
volume of academic spam. Unfortunately ACM outsourced filtering to
Postini, which was recently gobbled up by Google. So even if you make a
deliberate effort to avoid Google, they will scan every single incoming
mail that arrives to your forwarding address.

What Happened
-------------

As an ACM member, I made my forwarding address my primary address for
professional correspondence. When I learned about Google's interference,
I wanted to opt out from filtering, so I wrote the following email to
tech support:

*Dear Sir/Madam,*

*I recently learned that Postini had been taken over by Google.
Therefore I would like to exclude my ACM forwarding address from email
filtering, as I am not comfortable with Google spying on my
correspondence. I wonder if it is possible.*

*Thank you.*

*Yours Faithfully,*  
*...*

I did not have to wait long for the response, although its content was
disturbing:

*Dear Peter Wittek:*

*Email forwarding has been deactivated as requested.*

*Sincerely,*  
*...*

When did I actually request deactivating forwarding? Unambiguous
sentences were never my forte, but the email I sent clearly stated that
I wanted to opt out from *filtering*, not *forwarding*. Even if I wanted
to deactivate forwarding, I could have just set a dummy email address on
my profile without asking for anybody's help.

My entire professional correspondence was blocked from around SGT
9.30pm, 7 August 2013. Emails sent to my address bounced. Google and NSA
were probably still able to read my incoming mails, but not me.

Naturally, I wrote several emails to reactivate my forwarding address,
even if the price was to continue being spied on. The time difference
between my location in Singapore and the headquarters in New York did
not facilitate a quick resolution either. As time passed, my requests
for reactivation became more and more desperate. Eventually email
forwarding was reactivated around SGT 9.30pm, 9 August 2013, accompanied
by the following note:

*All mail sent to your acm.org address will automatically pass through
an Spam and Virus filtering system.  
*

Google has you.

Outlook
-------

It is never a good idea to denigrate an organization that you are
associated with, but I believe that the integrity of ACM as a
professional body is compromised. If you attempt to opt out from spying,
you might face a 48-hour deactivation of your email. Although I had
decades to get used to it, extensive and unjustified surveillance still
bothers me even in 2013. I used to be proud being an ACM member, but now
I must consider changing allegiance -- preferably to a less
spying-prone, non-US-based professional body. I should also give up
chasing after the mirage of a permanent email address; it will never
happen.
